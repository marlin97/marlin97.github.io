## Introduction
Predicting when someone might miss a payment is is a valuable asset for many companies in the financial industry. Being able to detect when someone may default on their payments, on things such as loan as credit cards can help a financial institution make better decision to who they give credit to. Predicting defaults is just one of many ways Machine Learning can help the banking industry. In this project, we will explore if it is possible to reliably predict if someone will default on their credit card payments.
